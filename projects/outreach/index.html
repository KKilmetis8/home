<p><a href="https://www.physicstime.gr/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Physics Time</a> is a greek-language periodical published by the Postgrad Student Association of the Physics department of the University of Athens. It attempt to fill the gap between pop-sci articles and textbooks, giving the everybody from the interested high-schooler to the graduate who’s moved on to greener pastures something to chew on.</p>

<p>I contributed an article on the Magnus Effect, it lives <a href="https://www.physicstime.gr/articles/magnus-effect-roberto-carlos" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>A charismatic professor once tried to explain the Lorentz transformation through the use of an imaginary program which depending on the strength of the boost would draw the transformation. I made it real, using pure <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JavaScript</code> for easy deployment. <a href="https://kkilmetis8.github.io/Lorentz-Transformation/">Check it out!</a></p>

<p>I gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AAfJ2Velz0&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">colloquium</a> on typesetting documents with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TeX</code> to the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) Group in Physics Department of the University of Athens. Overleaf’s prevalence and improvement has made local <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TeX</code> kind of obsolete, but I still think its worth knowing how to set it up.</p>
