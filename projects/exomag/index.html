<p>Magnetic fields are the closest humanity has come to magic. It is an invisible field which despite doing no work has a profound effect on everything. Take the Earth’s magnetic field for example. Without it, the solar wind would have fried this planet sterile. Plausibly then, we might imagine that planetary magnetic fields are key ingredients of planetary habitability. Other planets like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system poses magnetic fields as well. We can attest to that for a variety of reasons, but the most visually impressive one is Aurorae (Northern Lights) on their poles, as seen in the image below.</p>

<p>Aurorae are visible not only in the optical wavelengths but also in the radio. An exoplanet (planet outside our solar system) with a strong enough magnetic field could induce an Aurora strong enough to be detected from the Earth.</p>

<p>With these thoughts mind, we used <a href="https://mesastar.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MESA</code></a> to simulate planetary atmospheres and interiors. We focused our efforts in Jupiter and Neptune like planets close to their parent stars. We aimed to study the interplay between strong stellar irradiation and the convective motions in the interiors of planets that result in magnetic fields. Knowing how the planets interior evolved, we could calculate the expected strength of the magnetic field and from that in which frequency we could detect the Aurora.</p>

<p>The results of our numerical experiments are summarized in the figure above. We found that larger atmospheric envelopes, that is more of the planet’s mass being gaseous rather than in a metallic core lead to stronger magnetic fields.</p>

<p>This project was undertaken together with Aline Vidotto, Andrew Allan and Darya Kubyshkina. The publication <a class="citation" href="#exomag24">(Kilmetis et al., 2024)</a>. that came out of it was awarded the MNRAS 2025 Student Author Prize.</p>
